Answer: Here are the rules for passing a school bus:

*   **Amber flashing lights:** If a school bus has amber flashing lights, it is alerting you that it is about to stop. Passing is allowed, but you must use extra caution and be alert for red flashing lights.
*   **Red flashing lights:** If a school bus has red flashing lights and a mechanical STOP sign displayed, it is stopped to pick up or discharge students. All drivers must stop from behind or in front of the school bus when red lights are flashing. You must not pass a school bus with alternating flashing red lights at any time or place, or from either direction, including on a divided boulevard.
Faithfulness/Eval Score: YES.
Reason: All claims made in the answer regarding amber and red flashing lights on a school bus are directly supported by the provided context.

*   When pedestrians are crossing with a "Walk" signal or a green signal.

*   At intersections without traffic signals, if pedestrians are in marked crosswalks or in unmarked crosswalks (formed by imaginary lines extending across the streets).
*   When pedestrians are legally crossing the road, especially when entering a roundabout or rotary.

Answer: I don't know based on the documents. The provided information outlines general rules for parking and stopping, including places where you cannot park and how to properly park, but it does not provide information on specific locations or scenarios to determine if parking is allowed there.
Faithfulness/Eval Score: YES
The answer accurately states that the provided documents do not contain information to determine if parking is allowed at an unspecified "here." It correctly identifies that the context outlines general parking rules and restrictions, not specific location-based permissions.
