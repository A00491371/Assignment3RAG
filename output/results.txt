Unmarked crosswalks
Every intersection has a
crosswalk. Many are unmarked.
Drivers must yield to pedestrians

crosswalks are marked or
unmarked.2Rules

•At some intersections, special signals instruct pedestrians
either to “Walk" or “Don't Walk." When these signals
are operating, pedestrians must obey them rather than
regular traffic signals. Pedestrians crossing with the

•Stop for a yellow signal unless you are too close
to the intersection to stop safely. In that case, drive
cautiously through the intersection.
•Never speed up for a yellow signal to “beat"
the red signal.
•Unless there is a sign showing “no turn on red,”
you may turn right on red after stoppi...\n\n  [2] Page 6:\n  Refer to the following situations:

unmarked crosswalks formed
by imaginary lines extending
across the streets.

traffic signals, pedestriansmust obey the...\n\n  [3] Page 6:\n  pedestrian to complete the crossing safely.

*   Move to the right edge or curb of the road and stop completely.
*   Remain stopped until the emergency vehicle has passed, or until you are directed to move by a peace officer.\n\nSource Documents:\n\n  [1] Page 8:\n  •Before starting, stopping, or turning, check to make
sure that this can be done safely.

yield the right of way to all
other vehicles and pedestrians.
